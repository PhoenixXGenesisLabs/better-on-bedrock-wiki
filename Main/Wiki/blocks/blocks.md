</div>

### Info

The Bounty Board is a block that is provides a Bounty Scroll. This block can not be mined or obtained. This block is found inside of a Trader Outpost, which is a rare structure in the overworld.

This block is intractable. Once the player interacts on the block, it will drop a Bounty Scroll!

Refer to [this page](https://poggy.org/Main/Wiki/items/quests_bounties.html#bounties) to learn more about the Bounty Scroll.

## Waystone

</div>

### Info

Waystones are a neat way for players to travel from point A to point B. It costs XP to travel from one Waystone to another, and extra XP if you travel across dimensions.

### How to use

Waystones can be toggled to either be global or private. Global means if Waystone A was saved with "Global" being enabled, anyone in that world will see the Waystone, and they would be able to teleport to it, which is honestly pretty great for multiplayer worlds!

</div>

The Waystone Key can also be used to access the Waystone menu from any location in the world.

### How to find

This block is found inside a Waystone Tower or Crafting.

## Miner Bench

### Info

### How to use

To use the Miner Bench, you need to hold either a `pickaxe`, `axe`, `hoe` or `shears` and use the block. This will prompt a UI with instructions to follow.

### How to find
