A page that will serve as a guide/walkthrough though Quests and Bounties is in the works, and will be added at a later date!

## Quests

</div>

### Info
Quests are pretty neat. Players spawn with a Rolled Up Quest Scroll, and it can be crafted!

 They start as a guide for the player and slowly progress into a goal for completionists. Quests are optional but are a great way for players to advance through the game as they are rewarded upon completing a quest.

There are a few quest tiers, and each tier has a list of quests that follows the sort of theme of the tier.

## Acquired Quests
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

</div>

### Info
There aren't only pre-unlocked quests. There are also quests that players can buy!

Players can buy quests from Librarian Villagers for emeralds, and once they consume the item, they will unlock a random quest in the "Acquired Quests" section. They follow the same formula as base quests.

"Locked" will show all available quests that need to be bought. As mentioned before, unlocking them are random.

:::info
If you happen to buy a quest that tries to unlock a quest that you own, it'll grant you a few xp.
:::

"Available" will show you all quests that you have unlocked and are yet to complete.

"Completed" is pretty self explanatory

## Bounties
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/Main/assets/bounty_scroll_open.png" alt="Example Image" width="64">
</div>

### Info
Bounties work the same as quests, but can be found inside a Trader outpost which can spawn anywhere in the Overworld. It gives players a type of quest that requires them to hunt down mobs for rewards.

Refer to [this page](https://poggy.org/Main/Wiki/blocks/blocks.html#bounty-board) to learn how to obtain a Bounty Scroll.
