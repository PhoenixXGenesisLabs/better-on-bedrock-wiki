### How do I add to my tools?

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/Main/assets/blocks/enchant_table.png" alt="Example Image" width="128">
</div>

All you need to do is hold the tool you want to enchant, being Pickaxe, Axe, Shears or Hoes, then interact on the block, which will prompt you with a UI asking you if you want to enchant.

You do require 6XP levels, as well as the correct book for what you want to enchant.
