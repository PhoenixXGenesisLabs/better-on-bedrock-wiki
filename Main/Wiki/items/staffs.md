### Info
There are 4 staff types. These staffs use manna. Some staffs have 2 attacks, while some only have 1.

A staff will loose manna as it's being used, but manna can be refilled to a staff if it's repaired with soul in an anvil.

Soul is dropped from undead mobs.
### Where to find
Magic Staffs are found by trading with a Lonely Wizard. This mob spawns in a house in forest biomes.
