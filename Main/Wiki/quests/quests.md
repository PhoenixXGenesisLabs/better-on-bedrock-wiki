# Quests
Quests are way for players to do task while also being rewarded for it! They also act as a guide for the player while they play the add-on. Quests are not required.

## The Basics
Once you open the quest scroll, you will be prompted with this menu.

`Main` is the base set of quests. They consist of quest tiers. Each tier has its own set of quests, and they are progressive.

`Bought Quests` are quests which you buy from Librarian Villagers. Once you buy a quest, you consume the item to unlock them.
